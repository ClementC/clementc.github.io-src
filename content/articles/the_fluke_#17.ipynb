    "Then after a classic by Creedence Clearwater Revival, we'll have a song from Don Cavalli, a French blues singer and guitar player. The first time I heard one of his songs, I thought it was a recording from the 1930s, because he likes to record with a very rough sound akin to the early Mississipi blues albums.\n",

    "We end with a nice song from the blind Cuban singer and guitar player Raul Midón, and a track from the album \"Jazz Impressions from Japan\" by the Dave Brubeck Quartet. This album is very soft, and I find it to be a nice way to rediscover Dave Brubeck (I've heard \"Take Five\" and \"Blue Rondo A La Turk\" too many times...).\n",
