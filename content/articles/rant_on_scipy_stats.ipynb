My goal was to to a generalized mixture, using Gamma distributions instead of more classical Normal distributions.\n",

Easy, right?\n",

    "For instance, to parametrize the Normal distribution you have to plugin the mean $\\mu$ as the `loc` parameter, and the standard deviation $\\sigma$ as the `scale` parameter, which feels quite natural.<br>\n",
