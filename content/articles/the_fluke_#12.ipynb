    "We get bluesy this week in The Fluke, with Popa Chubby in a Louisiana-infused track, and Tinariwen (written ‚µú‚µè‚µî‚µì‚µè in [Tifinagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tifinagh)), a very intense sounding desert blues band. They won a [Grammy award in 2020](https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/tinariwen/10715) in the \"Best Global Music Album\" category for their album. I really recommend watching their animated, dream-like clips! Popa Chubby is kind of far from what I'm listening these days, but he holds a special place in my heart, since it's the first concert I went to see on my own.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also threw in there a track by Max Richter, from the movie Waltz with Bashir. The film is hard to watch, I remember being shaken when I was out of the cinema. It really deserves all of its awards.\n",
    "Richter has \"re-composed\" a version of Vivaldi's Four Seasons a few years ago, which is very much worth a listen, especially if you know well the original piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some novelty: the playlists are now available on Deezer (french competitor to Spotify üá´üá∑), by popular demand of multiple (>1) people. I updated the articles on previous playlists to add the corresponding links.\n",
    "\n",
    "So here are the links [on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14uMZb3MyuI6sEJWib89iD?si=32861385b98b404b), [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/fr/playlist/9126082002), and [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8g99k_gagFQOKa4v3BCS38O9sq7ABS5r).\n",

    "See you next week!"
