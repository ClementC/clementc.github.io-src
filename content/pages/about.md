Hi! My name is Clément Chastagnol.
I'm a French, Paris-based software engineer, currently working at [IQVIA](https://www.iqvia.com/) (previously [Alan](https://alan.com/) and [Sidetrade](https://www.sidetrade.com/)), focusing on data science for health data.

I am also an amateur musician: I play keyboards with [Victoria Caffè](http://www.victoriacaffe.fr/), and sometimes record [small things on my own](https://soundcloud.com/herr-doktor-funk/tracks).

Thanks for visiting!
