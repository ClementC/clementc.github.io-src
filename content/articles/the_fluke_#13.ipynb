Please go on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtWuB1D_E3mcyYThA9iKggQ), the clips are really nice, and by the second or third one you'll be totally addicted to their musical jingle :)\n",

    "I first heard the song \"The Death of J.B. Lenoir\" in the documentary \"The Soul of a Man\" by Wim Wenders. It's part of a series on the blues, produced by Martin Scorcese. It is incredibly good. In particular, the story behing the song I chose is very sad and moving.\n",
