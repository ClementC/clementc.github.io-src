    "\"Manifesto\" by Chilly Gonzales, the song concluding this week's playlist, is a favorite of mine when it comes to solo piano. Interestingly, I couldn't find the album version on YouTube, so I linked a live version. It's a particular one, since it was recorded during the famous \"27 hours\" concert he gave in Paris in 2009. With this concert, he broke the Guiness World Record in the \"longest concert by a solo artist\" category.\n",
